# Mission

High-Five (name pending) is a web application catering to young black and brown users. The mission is to make extracurricular (specifically non-profit) organizations and programs more accessible and reachable to the youth. A user can search from our database for programs/companies providing technology support, youth programming, after-school programs, summer-school programs, internships, etc.

## Proof of Concept

Users can search and filter for an organization by category and/or program dates (ie. seasonal programs)

## User Stories

[] User should be able to find an organization based on their interest, location, programs and internship opportunities geared towards their needs

[] User should be able to inform themselves about the organization

[] User will be able to share organization info with a friend at a click of a button to various social media platforms
Established organizations will be able to add programs to our database

## Example #1

Chloe wants to find a summer activity before school lets out in a couple of weeks. She is interested in exploring local arts within her community. Chloe can go onto our site and filter through programs and organizations by the ‘Arts’ category and by the date she is available during the summer. She can select an organization’s page to see their information and how to sign up for the program.

## Example #2

Richard learns the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) has been suspended due to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. He is interested in finding employment by way of internships in his neighborhood to work on projects that help him grow and gain a new skill in the tech industry during the summer. He can go onto our site and filter Internship Opportunities by date for the perfect matches to apply for.
